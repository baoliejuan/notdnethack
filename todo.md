This is ndnh 2. It's like ndnh 1, but it's based on a newer version of dnh. A lot of stuff from ndnh 1 was a hit and needs to be reimplemented here.
Additonally, there are some new ideas.
- [ ] Chaos 1 improvements including mini loot being buffed and add another MAJOR resist
- [ ] Full Illithanachronounbinder patch, potentially with some changes but mostly true to the source.
- [ ] A very different version of the caveman flint knapping/spearhead point patch
- [ ] Potion vapor improvements and a likely heavily modified version of the alchemy gnome patch
- [ ] A modified version of the caveman 
- [ ] Sigil + Fell + spire + key split maybe?
- [ ] Village level + mildly changed adventure branches
- [ ] Etherealoid race, potentially slightly nerfed
- [ ] Symbiote race, likely better implemented?
- [ ] Cowboy role, complete with a six shooter, lasso, some weird quest, and spurred boots
- [ ] Salamander race + rebel salamander quest
- [ ] Monk styles, potentially cheaper pw cost
- [ ] Barb Styles, potentially split these off to a new role if chris finds a better way to make barb less OP and more interesting?
- [ ] Pirate king's crown replacing reaver as well as infinite weight treasury of proteus
- [ ] Ana salamander + flamethrower
- [ ] Ana nightvision goggles giving extramission
- [ ] Ana hlf force armor
- [ ] Ana clkwk loyal to dnh 1 implementation including power armor
- [ ] Armorsmith patch
- [ ] Do something about sokoban that isn't lokoban
- [ ] Give red dragon scale stuff flying
- [ ] Special vibe square level probably isn't coming back as it was; may see something new


Stuff that isn't coming back
- Healer whack healing explosion/crossbow bolt thing
- Spell overloading (until I can figure out how to offer it in a less stupid way)
- Monk -> Mystic name change
- Digout artifact
- Hunting Horn Bard artifact. DNH made singing sword after I made this, and it is way cooler
- Automatic law soldiers likely not returning, or if they do, in a more interesting way
- Portal skip for outlands
